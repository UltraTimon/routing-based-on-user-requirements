# TODO

- Make an overview of ALL tasks that need to be done & put them into a timed planning
- Find out if final hand-in of thesis is 2 or 1 weeks before defense date
- Let Fernando know when we can plan defense, keeping in mind that the final thesis needs to be handed in 2 (or 1) weeks before defense date
- Then: Sign green light!!




# Tasks that need to be done still (TODO: Insert in table & add time estimates for each task)

- Add in the proof for the completeness of globalBFS to show it produces globally optimal paths
- Think about & write about what amounts and distributions of BER makes the problem more difficult, which informs what amounts & distributions are chosen for each experiment
- Find 4 realistic graph types for evaluation
- Argue that showing that the heuristic works well on these graph types indicates that the heuristic is useful in practice
- For each graph type:
  - Research realistic size for this type (e.g. for internet: 75k)
  - Generate multiple topologies for each size (say 5)
  - Run 'xperiments
  - Aggregate data into graphs that show performance (in terms of #BER) of heuristic compared to #BER of globally optimal paths
