- Hihglight contributions and explain why they are useful and scientific relevance

Update research questions to amke them more abstract and less specific, you should understand them before detailig the heuristic etc, they are more broad

- Why use these maps instead of 4 internet graphs ?

-------

- AS graph with different BER amounts
- AS grsph with different BER distributions over nodes (normal relateive to degree?)

- sclaalbility of heuristic: checkif straight line or growing exponentially

- Maybe; Worst possible setup wit grid  & distributions

- Provide agregate percentages of how close the heuristic is to the globalBFS in #BER
- do a CDF of the difference between heuristic and globalBFS instead of vague lines


--------------

- Writing:
  - Structure:
    - Start with bullet points: what u wnt to say in order of treatment
    - From bullets: Derive initial structure with headings & stuff
    - Per section: More detailed contents
  - SHOW THAT YOUR THING IS USEFUL
    - Showing thing in idfferent circumstances
    - Explain how you set it up & why (ESPECIALLY WHY)
  - Intro:
    - Always say:
      - what is the problem
      - why is the problem important & relevant
      - Why is the problem hard (justifies this thing being the content of a Msc thesis)
        - NP-hard
        - heuristic
        - what are the tradeoffs --> we look at that
      - how did we solve the problem
- Quickly mention the realistic dataset we tried to make (wit geo, address etc.) and then say that this was so hard that we sticked to edgelists from CAIDA
- Discussion: Mention latency triplets idea

--------------

- spellcheck
- explain things carefully
- make clear what the main contributions are, show its not trivial and meaningful --> how I write things down is important
- I hvae one chance to leave good impressions
- Ask johan whether he wants hardcopy


----------

- Johan should also give green light


----------

- Send intro to Adrian & other finished stuff (maybe evaluation section structure)
- Increase font size s.t. its readable when printed & readable for old people
- matplotlib use safevig with pdf format, this makes it supa sharp
- ask about variable margins around graphs when using savefig on stackoverflow
- Also make lines marked with markings for black & white printed & colorblind people


- Keep presentation figures much more simple than report
