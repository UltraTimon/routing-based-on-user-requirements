 Proof exactness of BER

- Integrate it inTO bgo without any change to the protocol

- How and why adjust things and why it should be adopted

There is promise, let's see how it can go

- FOcys on algoirthmic part

For bgP can just focus on talk no implementation


Describe the data sets generation and hwo I got that: Write about it clearly, show that things are not intuitive and complex

Write about latency triplets

Maybe 8 with modifed dijkstra

-------------


Speedup
Intgration into internet


For algorithm:

- IF same size, which do you pick?

-----------

Come up with cases that fail, be more critical, make this

Proving 'hardness' of this problem

Maybe SAMCRA??  MAybe tamcra, liit nr of intermediate results..?


Gary & Johnson NP hard problems

Google NP hard problems

CARPS CARBS 21 NP hard problems

------------

Run dijktstra while filtering requirements

- FInd shortest path
- Check paths for compliance
- Do it iterative per shortest path
